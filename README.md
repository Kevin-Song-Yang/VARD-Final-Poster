# This was a technical project that I had the opportunity to work on prior to the beginning of my sophomore year. We were able to work with an acute care surgeon from the Lehigh Valley Health Network to design prototypes in Solidworks given specifications. 

# A big thank you to Professor Susan Perry and Professor Lori Herz as well as Dr. Matthew Painter!
